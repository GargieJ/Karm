This file contains a clear and precised version of the problem statement.

1. Employment Gaps in Blue-Collar Hiring
  Blue-collar workers often rely on informal hiring channels such as word-of-mouth networks, local contractors, or intermediary agents. These systems lack              transparency, standardized verification, and digital traceability. As a result, workers face wage exploitation, inconsistent employment, and limited upward mobility.

2. Digital Platform Mismatch
  Most mainstream job platforms are optimized for white-collar roles. They prioritize resumes, formal education, and corporate workflows. Blue-collar hiring,           however, is often skill-based, location-dependent, and urgent in nature. Existing platforms do not adequately serve these structural differences.

3. Third-Gender Employment Barriers
  Third-gender individuals face systemic discrimination in hiring processes. Many digital platforms enforce binary gender classifications, lack inclusive identity      options, and fail to create safe digital spaces for marginalized communities. This results in reduced employment access and social exclusion.

4. The Need for an Inclusive, Structured System
  There is a need for a recruitment platform that:
  a. Prioritizes blue-collar job structures
  b. Integrates inclusive gender representation
  c. Ensures transparent hiring workflows
  d. Provides scalable architecture for long-term growth
